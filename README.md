# Loan-Repayment-Problem-Prediction

Author: Adedayo K. Adebayo


A simple model is built using the train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv data set for predicting Loan repayment. This project is organized as follows: 
(a) Importing libraries and Data preview; 
(b) Data cleaning;
(c) Data visiualisations and Exploratory Analysis;
(d) Data Pre-processing for Model Building;
(e) Creating and Comparing models; and 
(f) Conclusion.

train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv: dataset used for model building.

Models used:
(a) XGBoost
(b) Logistic Regression
(c) Decision Tree Classifier
(d) Random Forest Classifier
(e) K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

Loan Repayment Prediction.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook containing code.
